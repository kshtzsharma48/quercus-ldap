This library provides an (incomplete) implementation of PHP 5's LDAP functions for use with the
Quercus Java implementation of PHP 5. See http://quercus.caucho.com

To use this library, build quercus-ldap.jar (see below) and place it in the WEB-INF/lib directory of
your web app, or your application server's shared library directory.

Compiling:
You will need Apache Ant (tested with 1.7.0) and a Java 1.5 compiler. If you wish to run the unit
tests, you will also need OpenLDAP on your system and to set up a test.properties file. "ant test"
will run the unit tests, and "ant dist" will create dist/quercus-ldap.jar.
